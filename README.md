# Refactor-The-Soup

##Purpose
To clean up this DIV soup for other developers to work with ease.To also ensure site functions properly and HTML5 and CSS follow semantic order.

##Built With
*HTML5
*CSS


This is my first refactor project. Adding accessibility for all to enjoy!

In this project, we have taken an existing website and refactored the HTML and CSS Files.

When reading this HTML file, you will see added comments to better define each section.
As the name "Refactor-The-Soup" implies, we are cleaning up the HTML file of the many div elements.
I have replaced many div elements with new opening/closing tags to better section off our HTML.
By implementing these changes, we are better able to style our page more accurately.
While refactoring the HTML file, we are also consolidating the CSS file.
By replacing div with other commonly used tags, we can see more clearly what styles are affecting what tags.
I have also removed repeated CSS styling and rearranged our style sheet to match the semantic structure of the HTML.
